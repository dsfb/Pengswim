To install, type:

./configure --with-font=/usr/share/fonts/default/TrueType/helb____.ttf

The font can be any TrueType font of your choosing, but you MUST specify one if 
you do not have the font listed above in that location.

If you want to install to a directory besides /usr/local, 
you'll need to use the '--prefix=/whatever' option.  Check ./configure --help for 
more options.

Then type:

make
make install
